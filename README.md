I am building a personal website for tinkering and sharing interesting things.

This is a react/typescript SPA using [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/) web3 scaffolding as a starting point.

Initial iteration live on IPFS at [cmcgee.net]():
- If using Brave (or another web3 browser) with IPFS enabled, this should redirect to [ipns://cmcgee.net]() and pull the site directly from IPFS
- Otherwise, it will we pulled from Azure (Static Web App)

Future Plans:
- Resume download link
- Nostr
- Embed social media?
- Blog
- ENS name?
